This is a repo where I'm keeping my exercises as I follow along to Kosuke Imai's *Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction.* Princeton University Press, 2018. Exercises will be in the R programming language. I am using RStudio to make life easier. 

Some of these may be assigned as homework questions in courses. If so, don't copy my homework, as you're not doing yourself any favors learning from me.
